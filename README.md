# Flight Status Tracker

**Flight Status Tracker** is a web application that provides real-time updates on flight statuses, including delays, cancellations, and gate changes. Designed with a dynamic frontend using HTML, CSS, and React.js, it offers users an interactive experience with constantly updated flight information. The backend, built with Python and Flask, serves API endpoints to fetch and update flight data, while MongoDB handles the storage and management of flight details. 

To enhance user engagement, the app utilizes Firebase Cloud Messaging to send real-time notifications about flight status changes. The system is designed to simulate high server load by updating departure and arrival times every second, ensuring that users receive the most current information. The setup includes a straightforward process for running the backend and frontend, managing the database, and handling notifications.
